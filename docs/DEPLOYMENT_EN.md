# Deployment Guide

## 1. Prepare VPC (optional)

This solution can be deployed in both public and private subnets. Using public subnets is recommended.

- If you want to use existing VPC, please make sure the VPC has at least 2 subnets, and both subnets must have public internet access (Either public subnets with internet gateway or private subnets with NAT gateway)

- If you want to create new default VPC for this solution, please go to Step 2 and make sure you have *Create a new VPC for this cluster* selected when you create the cluster.


## 2. Set up ECS Cluster

A ECS Cluster is required for this solution to run Fargate task.

Go to AWS Management Console > Elastic Container Service (ECS). From ECS Cluster home page, click **Create Cluster**

Step 1: Select Cluster Template, make sure you choose **Network Only** type. 

Step 2: Configure cluster, just specify a cluster name and click Create. If you want to also create a new VCP (public subnets only), please also check the **Create a new VPC for this cluster** option.

## 3. Configure credentials

If source (or destination) is NOT in current AWS account, you will need to provide `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey` (namely `AK/SK`) to pull from or push to Amazon ECR. And Secrets Manager is used to store the credentials in a secure manner.

>Note: If source type is Public, there is no need to provide the source credentials.

Go to AWS Management Console > Secrets Manager. From Secrets Manager home page, click **Store a new secret**. For secret type, please use **Other type of secrets**. For key/value paris, please copy and paste below JSON text into the Plaintext section, and change value to your AK/SK accordingly.

```
{
  "access_key_id": "<Your Access Key ID>",
  "secret_access_key": "<Your Access Key Secret>"
}
```
